RFM Metrics calculation:

1. SQL Query to Calculate RFM:

-- 1. Set the latest date in the dataset as the reference date
SELECT MAX(InvoiceDate) AS LastInvoiceDate FROM Transactions;
Assume the latest date is 2011-12-09.

2. Recency Calculation:

SELECT 
    CustomerID,
    DATEDIFF('2011-12-09', MAX(InvoiceDate)) AS Recency
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY CustomerID;

Explanation:
DATEDIFF calculates the number of days since the last purchase.
A lower value indicates recent activity.

3. Frequency Calculation:

SELECT 
    CustomerID,
    COUNT(DISTINCT Invoice) AS Frequency
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY CustomerID;

Explanation:
Counts unique invoices to measure how often the customer makes purchases.

4. Monetary Calculation:

SELECT 
    CustomerID,
    SUM(TotalPrice) AS Monetary
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY CustomerID;

Explanation:
Sums the total spending per customer.

SELECT 
    r.CustomerID,
    r.Recency,
    f.Frequency,
    m.Monetary
FROM 
    (SELECT CustomerID, DATEDIFF('2011-12-09', MAX(InvoiceDate)) AS Recency
     FROM Transactions
     GROUP BY CustomerID) AS r
JOIN 
    (SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(DISTINCT Invoice) AS Frequency
     FROM Transactions
     GROUP BY CustomerID) AS f ON r.CustomerID = f.CustomerID
JOIN 
    (SELECT CustomerID, SUM(TotalPrice) AS Monetary
     FROM Transactions
     GROUP BY CustomerID) AS m ON r.CustomerID = m.CustomerID;
